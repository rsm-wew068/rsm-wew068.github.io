The old setup for years:

user query -> choose robot -> authorization -> prompt injection (attack detection) -> context -> intent classification (pure LLM) -> run all below in parallel ->
1. infoagent (datetime, location, call external API) 
a.  web search -> reply
b.  web search -> if insufficient info -> LLM reply
c.  if insufficient info -> reply
-> 2. data detective (real data)
-> 3. cokeys (relevant keywords) -> keyword matching (like 25 days before) ->  RAG -> doc -> embedding -> vector db -> plan -> chunk -> LLM reply
-> 4. LLM reply (fallback)
-> all conversations stored
-> feedback for quarterly report
-> sent previous 2 questions and answers -> context -> intent classification (pure LLM) -> run all below in parallel ->

The new setup by me:

user query -> choose robot -> authorization -> prompt injection (attack detection) -> 
FAQ cache check (with cache warming & TTL strategy) -> if cache hit: return cached response
-> sent previous 2 questions and answers -> context -> 
context-aware intent classification (fine-tuned transformer with calibrated confidence scores) -> top-k route selection based on confidence scores ->

Route intentions:
1. infoagent: "appointment_booking", "location_inquiry", "service_hours", "real_time_status"
   - datetime, location, call external API with response caching
   - web search -> reply or LLM reply if insufficient info
2. data detective: "vehicle_history", "purchase_records", "service_history", "warranty_status"
   - real data queries with connection pooling
3. cokeys: "technical_specs", "troubleshooting", "policy_questions", "general_info"
   - relevant keywords -> keyword matching -> RAG -> doc -> OpenAI embeddings -> FAISS vector db -> plan -> chunk -> stream LLM reply
4. LLM reply: "conversational", "complex_reasoning", "multi_intent", "unknown"
   - fallback for everything else -> stream response

Execution strategy:
- High confidence (>0.8): Run only top route
- Medium confidence (0.5-0.8): Run top-2 routes in parallel with early termination on high-quality response
- Low confidence (<0.5): Run top-3 routes + fallback
- Intent-specific confidence thresholds based on historical accuracy and error costs
- Confidence score logging for continuous threshold adjustment

-> response evaluation (quality, relevance, safety checks)
-> response selection (if multiple routes executed) + cache successful responses
-> stream final reply to user (for LLM-generated responses)
-> all conversations stored
-> feedback for RLHF
-> A/B testing: 50/50 user split
  Primary metric: CSAT (Customer Satisfaction Score)
  Secondary metrics: Response time (avg, P95, P99), Resolution rate

Advanced optimizations:
- Cache warming for seasonal/trending queries with content-type based TTL
- Confidence score calibration based on historical accuracy per intent
- Early termination for parallel routes when high-quality response detected
- Intent confidence logging for continuous threshold optimization
- Latency percentile monitoring for worst-case performance tracking

Improvement highlights:
- Intent classification moved from pure LLM to a fine-tuned transformer model (e.g., BERT/RoBERTa) for better accuracy and speed
- FAQ cache layer for instant responses to common questions
- Context-aware routing that leverages conversation history for better intent classification
- Top-k route selection based on confidence scores to optimize resource usage
- Parallel execution for medium confidence scenarios
- Response caching and database connection pooling for performance
- Use of OpenAI embeddings for RAG to leverage state-of-the-art semantic understanding
- Enhanced monitoring and feedback loop for continuous improvement

Expected performance improvements:
- Time to first token: 0.3-0.5s (streaming starts immediately)
- Complete response time: 1.0-1.3s (40-50% improvement from 2.0s baseline)
- Cached responses: <0.1s (FAQ cache hits)
- Accuracy: 88-91% (3-6% improvement from 85% baseline)
- Cost reduction: 45-55% through smart routing, caching, and reduced parallel processing
- User satisfaction: Improved perceived speed through streaming
