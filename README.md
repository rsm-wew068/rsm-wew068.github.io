## My Expertise

From October 2023 to March 2024, I conducted [research on data-driven digital transformation](https://github.com/rsm-wew068/research-paper.git), developing the PAD (Prediction And Decision) methodology to bridge machine learning predictions with business strategy implementation. Using RFM analysis and supervised learning algorithms, I built logistic and linear regression models achieving 85.2% accuracy and R¬≤ of 0.713, processing 54,000+ transaction records. I presented findings at the 2024 International Conference on Big Data and Enterprise Resource Management, demonstrating automated marketing strategies and ROI improvement through targeted customer segmentation.

From September to December 2023, I worked as a Finance Intern at Virbac in Taipei, where I used SQL to extract and clean financial data, enabling accurate reporting across Asian branches. I also developed Tableau dashboards that allowed senior leadership to visualize financial KPIs more efficiently, enhancing both ad hoc report accuracy and speed. Additionally, I regularly used Excel and PivotTables to validate figures and streamline financial reporting processes.

Earlier, from September 2022 to January 2023, I served as a Teaching Assistant at Soochow University, where I led sentiment analysis and text mining in R on visitor reviews for the National Museum of History, uncovering key themes during its renovation. I applied TF-IDF to prioritize feedback, contributing to a 10% improvement in museum services, and supported students in data analysis while fostering an inclusive learning environment.

Prior to that, I interned as a Data Analyst at Growth Strategy in Taipei from June to August 2022. There, I performed competitive and sentiment analysis on online reviews to support an emerging skincare brand's market strategy. Using Python and R, I identified customer pain points and refined STP targeting, delivering insights that guided ad targeting and increased customer acquisition by 15% in Q3.

### üéº [Machine Learning for Music](https://github.com/rsm-wew068/music-generation.git)
Completed a full progression through modern music AI, starting with audio signal processing and advancing to symbolic and generative modeling. Covered MIDI classification, audio feature extraction, Markov chains, REMI tokenization, and diffusion models for audio generation. A major midterm assignment involved composer classification, sequence prediction, and genre tagging using CNNs and XGBoost.

- **Final Project**: 

Task 1: Unconditioned Symbolic Generation
- Use the MAESTRO 2018 dataset for high-quality MIDI piano performances.
- Separate harmony and melody generation to maintain musical structure.
* Chord generation: Train a 2nd-order Markov Chain to generate plausible chord progressions.
* Melody generation: Train an LSTM-based RNN to predict the next note in an 8-note melody sequence.
* Train both models from scratch using the MAESTRO data.
* Evaluate based on temporal and harmonic alignment, melodic continuity, and structural coherence.
* Merge sequences into playable MIDI files using pretty_midi.

Task 2: Conditioned Symbolic Generation
- Use the Nottingham folk music corpus (in ABC format) for multi-instrument music (melody, chords, bass).
- Learn using REMI tokenization and a Transformer decoder.
* Data augmentation: Transpose sequences ¬±1 and ¬±2 semitones to expand the training set ~5√ó.
* REMI tokenization interleaves melody, chord, and bass lines into structured tokens.
* Training:
    - Stage 1 (Baseline): The Transformer is trained on a 2k-sample subset for 10 epochs.
    - Stage 2 (Fine-Tuning): The model is fine-tuned on the full dataset with a validation split, learning rate scheduler, and gradient clipping over 30 epochs.
* Structured generation:
- Final music is generated in three sections: intro, climax (pitch-shifted +5, thinned), and resolution (pitch-shifted ‚àí4), forming a musical arc.
* Expressive decoding:
    - Trained MLP regressors predict note duration, MIDI velocity, articulation, and tempo.
* Evaluation:
- Qualitative music playback and validation loss monitoring were used for evaluation.
- The model‚Äôs ability to generate coherent multi-instrumental music was assessed by enforcing structured phrases and expressive performance.
* Output:
- Generated symbolic sequences are rendered into expressive MIDI and WAV files using music21 and fluidsynth.
