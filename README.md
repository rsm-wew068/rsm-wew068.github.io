### üéº [Machine Learning for Music](https://github.com/rsm-wew068/music-generation.git)
Completed a full progression through modern music AI, starting with audio signal processing and advancing to symbolic and generative modeling. Covered MIDI classification, audio feature extraction, Markov chains, REMI tokenization, and diffusion models for audio generation. A major midterm assignment involved composer classification, sequence prediction, and genre tagging using CNNs and XGBoost.

- **Final Project**: 

Task 1: Unconditioned Symbolic Generation
- Use the MAESTRO 2018 dataset for high-quality MIDI piano performances.
- Separate harmony and melody generation to maintain musical structure.
* Chord generation: Train a 2nd-order Markov Chain to generate plausible chord progressions.
* Melody generation: Train an LSTM-based RNN to predict the next note in an 8-note melody sequence.
* Train both models from scratch using the MAESTRO data.
* Evaluate based on temporal and harmonic alignment, melodic continuity, and structural coherence.
* Merge sequences into playable MIDI files using pretty_midi.

Task 2: Conditioned Symbolic Generation
- Use the Nottingham folk music corpus (in ABC format) for multi-instrument music (melody, chords, bass).
- Learn using REMI tokenization and a Transformer decoder.
* Data augmentation: Transpose sequences ¬±1 and ¬±2 semitones to expand the training set ~5√ó.
* REMI tokenization interleaves melody, chord, and bass lines into structured tokens.
* Training:
    - Stage 1 (Baseline): The Transformer is trained on a 2k-sample subset for 10 epochs.
    - Stage 2 (Fine-Tuning): The model is fine-tuned on the full dataset with a validation split, learning rate scheduler, and gradient clipping over 30 epochs.
* Structured generation:
- Final music is generated in three sections: intro, climax (pitch-shifted +5, thinned), and resolution (pitch-shifted ‚àí4), forming a musical arc.
* Expressive decoding:
    - Trained MLP regressors predict note duration, MIDI velocity, articulation, and tempo.
* Evaluation:
- Qualitative music playback and validation loss monitoring were used for evaluation.
- The model‚Äôs ability to generate coherent multi-instrumental music was assessed by enforcing structured phrases and expressive performance.
* Output:
- Generated symbolic sequences are rendered into expressive MIDI and WAV files using music21 and fluidsynth.

### üéÜ [Analyzing Unstructured Data](https://github.com/rsm-wew068/mgta415-unstructured-data.git)

- **Homework 2**: Word2Vec vs. GloVe embeddings and n-gram language models with smoothing
- **Homework 3**: Phrase mining and domain-specific embeddings using AutoPhrase on CS papers
- **Data Challenge**: Multi-class restaurant classification using TF-IDF, n-grams, and ensemble tuning (~81% F1)
- **Final Project**: Image classification via data prototyping on MNIST, EMNIST, and KMNIST using random sampling, K-Means clustering, and KNN. Evaluated trade-offs in dataset size vs. performance and benchmarked against CNNs with Lipschitz regularization. Authored by Ryosuke Aoguchi, Nicole Ou, Wei-Hsien (Rachel) Wang.
